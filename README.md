# Savoir-FAIR experiment repository

This repository has been created in parallel of the submission of a paper named "Savoir-FAIR: A Knowledge-based Approach To Declarative Quality Measure for Linked Data".

It contains the [rules declared for the reimplementation of FAIR-Checker](./Fairness/) and [the catalog of endpoint used for the experiments](./catalogs/all_catalog_edited.ttl).

Both elements are to be used with the [IndeGx framework](https://github.com/Wimmics/IndeGx).
